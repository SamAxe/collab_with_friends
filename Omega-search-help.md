Some examples for the FedWiki search at http://147.182.253.245/omega


# Search by date

An approximate last modified date can selected by year, month, or day

    year:2025
    month:202501
    day:20250101

# Search by site
    site:fed.wiki

# Search by title
    title:"Welcome Visitors"

# Search by embedded html

But often omitting the prefix finds the results
